## Moment you failed

I had to make people test a crucial part of the product, but they weren't really testing. I overcome this by making myself available and teaching them how to use the platform. For the time I maintained myself available, this worked.  
There was another time where people weren't really understanding the purpose of automating what we were automating. I had to explain them the advantages of the process automation and how it could help in speed of future analyses and maybe generate new ideas from having more data on the process steps.

## What motivates me

The thing I like to do most is programming, sometimes even in spare time. I like to learn new things, frameworks and exploring each of them. This comes as a blessing and a curse.
